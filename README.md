## Implement Multithreaded Merge Sort

### Assignments

#### 01: Merge Sort Files

##### Problem Statement

Inside the folder `/files` there are 2 files

- `in1.txt`
- `in2.txt`

The both contain some numbers (separate numbers in each line).

You have to read both files, merge all the numbers into one sorted array and then print that into a third file out.txt

##### Example

##### Input

Contents of `in1.txt`
```
4
7
2
```
Contents of `in2.txt`
```
1
9
3
```
##### Output

Contents of `out.txt`
```
1
2
3
4
7
9
```

##### Bonus

- Level 1: Make the program work for any number of files.
- Level 2: Make sure that the file read and write operations are on a separate thread
- Level 3: Make sure that the read operations can be all done in parallel (i.e. we are not waiting for file 1 to be read before we read file 2)

##### Submissions

- Create a new repository under your own account (not a fork of this repo)
- Create a files folder and copy in1.txt and in2.txt into it
- Finish the assignment, and upload the out.txt file to the files folder
- The repository should contain the final working code as well as the out.txt file
- Submit your assignment
